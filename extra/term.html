            <h2>Membership</h2>
            <p>1. <strong>Your Notflix membership continues until canceled.</strong> To access the service, you must have Internet access, a compatible device, and an active Payment Method. "Payment Method" refers to a valid, current, accepted method of payment. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for the next billing cycle.</p>

            <p>2. <strong>Subscription Plans:</strong> We offer various subscription plans, some provided in conjunction with third-party products or services. Notflix is not responsible for third-party products or services. Plan details, conditions, and limitations are disclosed during sign-up or through subsequent communications. You can review your subscription details under the "Account" section of our website.</p>

            <h2>Promotional Offers</h2>
            <p>We may offer special promotions or introductory memberships ("Offers").

        <section id="billing-and-cancellation">
            <h2>Billing and Cancellation</h2>
            <h3>1. Billing Cycle</h3>
            <p>Your subscription fee and any additional charges (e.g., taxes or transaction fees) are charged to your Payment Method on the specified payment date. The billing cycle varies by plan and may change under specific circumstances (e.g., unsuccessful payments or subscription changes). You can review billing details on the "Account" page.</p>

            <h3>2. Payment Methods</h3>
            <p>You must maintain one or more valid Payment Methods on file. If your primary Payment Method fails, we may charge an alternative Payment Method. You remain responsible for any unpaid amounts.</p>

            <h3>3. Updating Payment Information</h3>
            <p>Update your Payment Methods on the "Account" page. If updated by your provider, you authorize continued use of the updated information for payments.</p>

            <h3>4. Cancellation</h3>
            <p>You can cancel your membership anytime. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your billing period. Payments are non-refundable, and we do not offer credits for partial periods or unused content. Cancel through the "Account" page or, if using a third-party Payment Method, through their platform.</p>

            <h3>5. Price and Plan Changes</h3>
            <p>Subscription prices and plans may change. We provide at least 30 days' notice before changes take effect. You may cancel your membership if you do not wish to accept these changes.</p>
